00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,970
React is a JavaScript library and therefore you will need a good understanding of some essential JavaScript

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,110
fundamentals.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,080
So if your JavaScript is a bit rusty, then this section is for you.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:24,360
So we're going to review topics such as the structuring, the spread operator template, literals Ternaries

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,370
and asynchronous JavaScript with promises and async await.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,050
Now one of the things we do all the time in React is to work with immutable arrays.

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:43,590
And so we will spend some time with the important array methods, map filter, reduce and sort.

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,390
Now if you already know all these things, then please feel free to just skip this entire section and

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,430
move right to the next one.
