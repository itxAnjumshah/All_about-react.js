1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,320
So in React, we need to define values based on a condition all the time.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,130
And many times in situations where we cannot use an if else statement.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,170
And so let's now learn how to use the ternary operator instead.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,380
So in JavaScript, the ternary operator is a very special type of operator that has three operands.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,000
So three parts that are needed for this operator to work.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,020
So let's work here on the page's value again.

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,980
And so the first part of the ternary operator is a condition.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,870
So let's say pages greater 1000.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,070
So this is a condition and if this is true, the result of this operator will be whatever is after this

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,090
question mark.

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,930
So let's define a string here and let's say over.

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,800
1000.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,790
Then let's add this colon.

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,710
And for now I will just write another string here and then I will explain what's happening.

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,030
So less than 1000.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,900
So again, the ternary operator has three parts.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,300
The first part is this condition here.

18
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:21,730
The second part is this second operand, which is the result of the operation in case that the condition

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,490
is true.

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:29,260
And in case that the condition is actually false, then the result of this operator will be this third

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,850
part of the operator.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,420
Okay.

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,210
And in case that is confusing, just remember that an operator is a bit similar to a function, so it

24
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,660
always returns some value.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,910
So for example, if we have two plus two, then the operator here is the two and it will result basically

26
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,810
this four.

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,260
Right.

28
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,000
And this operator here.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,780
So the ternary operator again, will return this value here in case that the first operand is true.

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,550
So this condition is true.

31
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,890
And if it's false, then this part here will be the result of the operator.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,500
And then we can, as always, store that result into a variable.

33
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,150
So let's just call this the pages range.

34
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,500
Let's lock that here.

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,760
And so.

36
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,150
Uh, our pages are currently 1210, which is, of course, more than 1000.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,570
And so then here we get that pages rate is over 1000.

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,550
And if we had another book.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,320
So if here a book was get book ID to.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,650
Well, then our book still has 1210 pages because we are actually manipulating that value here.

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,660
Remember?

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,410
But let's take that out.

43
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:56,270
And then our book only has 295 pages, which will then result here in the string of less than 1000.

44
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,460
So then we can use this here, for example, to create another string.

45
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,210
Let's log that to the console.

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,590
And again using a template literal.

47
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,980
The book has.

48
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,950
Pages range.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,590
Page.

50
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,160
And so now we get the book has less than 1000 pages.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,850
Let's put this one here back and go also back to book number one.

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,570
And then we get the book has over a thousand pages.

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,390
Great.

54
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,700
So that's what we use the ternary operator for.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,630
So to define a variable conditionally and let's just quickly do that here again, right here in the

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:46,500
summary string, just so I can show you that we can really use any JavaScript that returns a value here

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,820
in one of these blocks.

58
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,520
So the book.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,790
Has.

60
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,180
Here will be our JavaScript block And then let me just write the end.

61
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,850
Been adapted as a movie.

62
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:13,370
And so here, basically, if the movie adaptation is true, then we want to return nothing.

63
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,950
And if it's false, we want to return not.

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,770
That makes more sense if we write it out.

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:27,230
So has movie adaptation, which we can again use because we already took it out of the object up here

66
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,880
in this destructuring.

67
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,550
So if has movie adaptation.

68
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,590
Then return nothing.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,110
And if not, then return the string.

70
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,240
Not okay.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,450
And well, that's a bit hard to see there.

72
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,110
So the book has been adapted as a movie, which makes sense because this year is true.

73
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,250
But once again if we change this to.

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,110
Number two here, then the book or.

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,580
Yeah, then the book is different.

76
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,900
It has no movie.

77
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,240
And so then or string should say.

78
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,980
The book has not been adapted as a movie.

79
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,910
Great.

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,040
So with this, we used a conditional right here inside the template literal and it would not have been

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,090
possible to use an if else statement here instead because an if else statement is well, as the name

82
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,410
says, it's a statement so it does not return a value.

83
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,780
So it would have been impossible to use that here.

84
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,260
And so then the ternary operator is exactly the way to go.

85
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,610
And as I said in the beginning, we do this all the time in React.

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,360
So this is one of these things that is really important to know before starting to write React applications.
