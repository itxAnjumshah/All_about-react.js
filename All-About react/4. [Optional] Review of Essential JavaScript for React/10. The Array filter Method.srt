1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,800
So next up is the filter method.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:11,750
And as the name says, we can use the filter method in order to filter out some elements of the array

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,820
based on a condition.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,020
So let's say that we want to create an array which only has books that have more than 500 pages.

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,420
So let's say.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,800
Long books.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,830
And then books dot filter.

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,310
Give it some more space right here and now.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,640
Here.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,840
The idea is the same thing as before.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,590
So again, we pass in a callback function which should return something.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,670
So again, each element of the array is a book.

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:56,380
And now here, instead of returning the value that we want in a new array, we need to return a condition

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,290
which will either be true or false.

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:06,100
And if the result of that condition is true, then the current element will go into the filtered array.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,020
But if it's false, then it will get filtered out, basically.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,850
So let's see that in action.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:21,460
And let's say book dot pages greater than 500 and that's already it.

19
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,690
So.

20
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,230
Let's put the long books here.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,850
Close down here.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,890
So long books should be this one.

23
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,060
And we see immediately that the array only has the length of three.

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,660
Now.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:44,790
So this one has 1216 pages, this one 658, and then here also more than 500.

26
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,360
So it worked.

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,720
And so let's now go again over this to see what actually happened.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,850
So just like in a map method, this function here, this callback will be called for each elements of

29
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,630
the array.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,780
So let's then go through the array one by one.

31
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,670
So this is the first element.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,090
And so here then this condition will be executed.

33
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,560
So book dot pages greater than 500 and indeed it is.

34
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,570
And so here, this function, this entire callback here will return.

35
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,170
True.

36
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,970
And so if it is true, then that element goes into the new array.

37
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,130
So into the new long books array.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,110
Okay, let's do the next one.

39
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,510
Here we have pages only 295.

40
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,530
And so then here in the second element of the array, this will become false.

41
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,640
And if it's false, then the element is basically filtered out.

42
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,280
It will not make it into the new array.

43
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,110
Then filter moves on to the next one.

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,770
Here we have 658, which we already saw here in the results.

45
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,970
And of course, that's because it has more than 500 here.

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,810
This one is again left out as it has only 200 and something.

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,640
And finally, the last one.

48
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,480
Yeah.

49
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,960
Game of Thrones is a long book, so that, of course, makes it into the long books array.

50
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,190
Nice.

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,330
Now we can actually keep adding new methods here.

52
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,620
So after this filter, we can chain on another filter.

53
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,960
And that's possible simply because this one here returns a new array and on arrays we can call filter.

54
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,760
Right?

55
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,540
Therefore, we can call filter here again.

56
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,750
And let's now say that we only want the books who have a movie adaptation.

57
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,900
So out of these three.

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,780
So book dot.

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,760
Pass movie adaptation.

60
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:57,050
And that's already it because this alone so this has movie adaptation is already a Boolean value.

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,680
So here we don't even need to write a condition because all we need is to return either true or false.

62
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,750
Right?

63
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,780
And so now long books, well, it's actually still three.

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,070
So it seems like all of these actually have movie adaptations.

65
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,300
Yeah, that's right.

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,140
So let's just put down here.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,790
So book number three, let's put it to false just to see what happens.

68
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,080
Now.

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,690
Right.

70
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,100
And now, indeed, that movie also has been filtered out.

71
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,360
So we just set Dune to false.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,720
And so now we only have here The Lord of the Rings and a Game of Thrones.

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,640
So these are the only two long books which have a movie adaptation.

74
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,290
So let's say long books.

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,390
With.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,230
Movie right now.

77
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,510
This one here was just to show you that we can chain multiple filters in practice.

78
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,610
It would probably be better to just do an end here, right?

79
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,350
So that would be more efficient.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,840
But this one also works.

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,640
So since this is so important.

82
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,300
So again, we use this filter really all the time in React.

83
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,300
This is really super important, this method.

84
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,830
Let's do another one here.

85
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,030
So let's only filter out adventure books.

86
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,840
So not actually filtering out, but let's basically filter for adventure books.

87
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,570
So that's a bit a better way of saying it.

88
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,400
So books dot filter and again it will loop over the entire books array.

89
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,290
And so let's do books.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,930
And then we're back to our genres array.

91
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,890
So remember that this is an array.

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:04,110
And now what we want is to include books in the array where the genres array includes adventure.

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,920
So we're looking for adventure books.

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,790
And so books dot genres should include.

95
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,650
Adventure.

96
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,980
So includes always returns either true or false.

97
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,860
And so right there, we have our condition.

98
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,120
Mm.

99
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,130
Okay.

100
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,470
So adventure books.

101
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,890
But actually, let's do something first.

102
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,870
So let's again chain another method here, and this time let's actually chain a map.

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,170
So that is also perfectly fine because we already know that this year returns an array.

104
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,530
And so then on an array we can always call map.

105
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,880
So again, let's call it book.

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,170
But of course, it could be called Anything that We Wanted.

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,100
So in all of these methods here, we called it book because that is what makes more sense semantically.

108
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,200
But if we just called it X like it would work the exact same way, right?

109
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,100
So this is just a function that we can call the parameter.

110
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,250
So the argument that it receives anything that we want.

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,090
So here again, let's just return the title so that the output is a little bit easier to read.

112
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:29,100
So the books that or where the genres include adventure are The Lord of the Rings Dune and this Harry

113
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,910
Potter book.

114
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,580
And so if we check that out, then Indeed.

115
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,700
Well, here we cannot see that.

116
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,100
That's because of the limitation.

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,640
Where we cannot see so deep into the object with a free version.

118
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,990
But I can assure you.

119
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,910
That, for example, The Lord of the Rings.

120
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah.

121
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,090
So you see, here we have adventure.

122
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,810
So this book made it into the final array.

123
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,190
This one does not.

124
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,090
That's why it was not there.

125
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,120
This one?

126
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,310
Yeah.

127
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,930
This one is also adventure.

128
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,490
And so is this one.

129
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,160
Somehow, Game of Thrones is not an adventure.

130
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,900
Not sure why that is.

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,250
Uh, but yeah.

132
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:19,980
So this is how we combine a filter and a map in an effective way to model our data exactly in the way

133
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,960
that we want it.

134
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:28,620
And so since front end development with React and really any other front end framework is really a lot

135
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,630
about working with data, these methods here are absolutely essential.
